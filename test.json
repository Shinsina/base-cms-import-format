In this case, we may either send you a letter stating that the book is no longer available and return your payment or back order for you if we know the book is coming soon.</FONT></P>\n<P><EM><STRONG><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica\" size=2>Q.

As soon as we receive your payment and order we try to process it same day or next day. We do not confirm orders because of the high volume we receive daily. Please allow for the time it takes for your check to arrive at our office, processing, and delivery time (depending upon what type of delivery you chose). You will only hear from us if your credit card has declined or other reasons such as the book is no longer in stock.</FONT></P>\n<P><STRONG><EM><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica\" size=2>Q.

That depends on what type of delivery option you chose. If you mailed your order and payment to us, please allow time for us to receive your order and processing. If you are located in the U.S., the delivery time is 7-10 business days. If you are international and you chose regular airmail service, your delivery time could take 6-8 weeks and is not trackable. The recommended shipping option for international is to use Courier Service for delivery in 10-15 business days and is trackable.</FONT></P>\n<P><STRONG><EM><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica\" size=2>Q.

These include the mild, high-foaming, detergent molecules called phosphobetaines; the emollient conditioning compounds, which have become known as phospholipids; and the antimicrobial super conditioning agents called phosphoquats.</p>\r\n<p>This article offers a review of the chemistry of natural phospholipids, synthetic phospholipids, phosphobetaines and phosphoquats. Naturally occurring lipids are actually triglycerides made by the reaction of a fatty acid and glycerin. These materials can be made in the laboratory with catalyst at a high temperature (180-200&deg;C). However, the reaction occurs in living cells at low temperatures using specifi c enzyme systems (Figure 1).</p>","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2009-09-22 14:40:03 EST","primarySite":"www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":914361,"name":"Focus on Technology Transfer","bodyOriginal":"","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2004-09-23 12:16:23 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":914366,"name":"Technically Speaking","bodyOriginal":"skin, skin care, antiperspirants, deodorants, makeup, vehicles","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2004-08-25 13:22:25 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":914371,"name":"Technically Speaking","bodyOriginal":"skin, skin care, cleansers, antiperspirants/deodorants, hair care, makeup, sunscreens, oral products, preservatives, nails, vehicles and raw materials","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2004-08-25 13:22:07 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":914376,"name":"The Inhibition of Metalloproteinases by Macrocystis pyrifera Extract","bodyOriginal":"","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2005-09-27 13:15:27 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":914381,"name":"The pH of the Stratum Corneum: An Update","bodyOriginal":"<p>About 10 years ago, I attempted to explain some of the features of pH measurements on the skin's surface.

The reason for this is that cosmetic scientists generally do not want their cosmetic ingredients to penetrate all the way through the skin into the systemic circulation. Nevertheless, the term &ldquo;cosmetic delivery&rdquo; is gradually being used more frequently in cosmetic research. Interestingly, this trend is following the increased use of functional ingredients and it will become evident that this is not coincidental. The objective of this paper is to identify what &ldquo;delivery&rdquo; means, to assess its relevance for cosmetic science and to give examples of how this knowledge may help to create better cosmetic products in the marketplace. But the first question to ask ourselves is, why do we need it?</p>\n<p>The efficacy of any product containing a functional ingredient is determined by two factors: a) the intrinsic activity of the active molecule, and b) the delivery of this molecule to its site of action. The intrinsic activity, or the capability to do something, is dictated by the functionality profile of an active ingredient, but does not guarantee that every product containing this functional ingredient is indeed functional. For the functionality to emerge, the active ingredient needs to be delivered to the site of action at relevant concentrations for a sufficiently long period of time to do its work. </p>\n<p>These functionality considerations apply to all types of active materials in a range of products. For example, hair conditioners need to be deposited onto the hair to do their work. On the other hand, skin lighteners need to penetrate the skin to inhibit the tyrosinase enzyme in melanogenesis. The overall efficacy of a product containing a functional ingredient is therefore the result of multiplying the intrinsic activity of the ingredient and its delivery. Both activity and delivery need to be optimized to obtain an effective product.</p>\n<p>While transdermal delivery is relatively well understood, the main factors affecting dermal delivery are still unknown, due to the difficulty of measuring dermal delivery. Therefore, it is not surprising to see that transdermal delivery systems are used to promote dermal delivery. However, from a safety point of view it is questionable whether using technology that is aimed at increasing the flow of active ingredient across the skin is the right technology to ensure the highest retention of functional ingredient in the skin.

The elastic resistance of the cellular walls to the hydrostatic pressure is generated by the progression of water toward the shore or by the assault of waves which break on the rocks and drag along the Aosa.

By far, the most popular category of emulsifiers is &ldquo;soap&rdquo; &ndash; the reaction product between a fatty acid typically stearic acid) and an alkali earth metal (typically sodium hydroxide, occasionally potassium hydroxide).</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Garamond-Book\" size=\"2\">Sometimes either an amine (such as triethanolamine) or ammonium hydroxide is used, though ammonium hydroxide is used less often due to its odor and volatility. This volatility was actually used to an advantage years ago by the Noxell Company when the ammonium hydroxide was used to neutralize stearic acid to form the O/W emulsifier.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Garamond-Book\" size=\"2\">Over time, the ammonia volatilized off to leave an excess of free stearic acid. This stearic acid crystallized to solidify the emulsion. The result was the &ldquo;crunch&rdquo; when you stuck your finger into the Noxzema cream. Additionally, the excess stearic acid gave a pearlescent appearance, creating great marketing potential. The product as sold was quite stable, however when the cream was stirred, an unstable lotion was formed.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Garamond-Book\" size=\"2\">The lotion was unstable because there was no significant concentration of emulsifier (ammonium stearate) remaining. Emulsions that are formed by using sodium or potassium stearate tend to have a high pH (7.5-8.5) and have a tendency to build in viscosity over time. This is probably due to the formation of a gel network of liquid crystalline nature in the external phase. The reader should keep in mind that monovalent soaps form O/W emulsions while polyvalent soaps form W/O emulsions. Remember Bancroft&rsquo;s Rule: the phase where the emulsifier is most soluble will become the external phase.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Garamond-Book\" size=\"2\">Soap emulsifiers have many positive attributes: </font>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">&bull; They are quite powerful (efficient).</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">&bull; They are cost-effective (inexpensive).</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">&bull; They are reliable. (They will emulsify almost any oil.)</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">&bull; They are temperature insensitive.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">They also have a few signifi cant negatives:</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">&bull; They must be used at a high pH (or else you don&rsquo;t have much soap).</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">&bull; They form emulsions that gel over time.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">&bull; They are incompatible with many (cationic) conditioning agents.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">&bull; They can dramatically increase the TEWL (Trans Epidermal Water Loss) by mobilizing the interstitial skin lipids.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">&bull; They can cause eye sting.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">&bull; They can cause skin irritation.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Nonionic emulsifiers (particularly the ethoxylates) address many of these negatives but have a few negatives of their own:</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">&bull; They are very temperature sensitive.

To meet this requirement, chemists have developed two ways to make clear emulsions: by micro emulsion1 and by refractive index matching. The former has been widely explored, leading to many microemulsion-conditioning products in the market. In contrast, the latter has not been widely explored because the physical principle is not well explained and there has been no practical methodology to follow to realize many different applications.</p>\r\n<p>In our exploration of refractive index matching in formulation of cosmetics, a practical method has been developed and leads to many unique formulations. Refractive index matching enables chemists to make many unique formulas that cannot be achieved by other methods. Refractive index matching should become a common technique for formulation chemists.</p>\r\n<p>Optical refraction: Consider a beam of light transmitted through air and directed onto the surface of a body of water. Some of the light is reflected at the interface between the air and water; the remainder enters the water and is transmitted through it. Every transparent material has a property called optical density, which is an inverse measure of the speed of light through the material. Because water has a higher optical density than air, the speed of light is reduced as the light enters the water. The beam of light changes direction abruptly as it enters the water because of the change in speed. This bending of the light ray is called optical refraction.</p>\r\n<p>Index of refraction: The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to its speed in a substance is called the index of refraction for that substance or the refractive index (RI). The index of refraction of a homogeneous substance is a constant quantity that is a definite physical property of the substance. Consequently, the identity of such a substance can be determined by measuring its index of refraction with an instrument known as a refractometer. Some indexes of refraction for common cosmetic ingredients are listed in Table 1.</p>\r\n<p>What cosmetic chemists want to know is how to calculate the refractive index of a solution and how to design a formula with the refractive index of each ingredient in solution. Experimentally, it turns out that if one mixes several miscible ingredients together to form a clear homogeneous liquid phase, the refractive index of the mixture can be calculated from each individual component&rsquo;s refractive index in the composition. The calculated value of refractive index normally is very close to the value measured instrumentally.</p>","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2009-06-24 16:47:19 EST","primarySite":"www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":914941,"name":"Oral Care Formulary","bodyOriginal":"oral care, mouthwash, toothpaste","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2004-09-23 23:40:40 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":914946,"name":"Video Imaging in the Measurement of Makeup Efficacy and Performance","bodyOriginal":"<p>Makeup was created in the Middle East 5,000 years ago in order to give a more attractive appearance.

Slowly, the environment began to change and certain organisms, evolving the capability of photosynthesis, began to convert available carbonates hidden in the oceans and soils into oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitric oxide prevalent in the world today.</p>\r\n<p>The world changed from one of reduction to one of combustion and oxidation. As a consequence, organisms destined to survive in this new environment had to evolve a new set of defenses to keep from incinerating in the oxygenrich atmosphere. Every organism had to evolve to resist oxidative stress and humans were no exception. The ability of humans to resist oxidative stress is fundamental to our survival. Without built-in defense mechanisms designed to combat the forces that would send our bodies up in flames, we would not be here to discuss the issue. The Second Law of Thermodynamics even suggests that our bodies would be happier in a more chaotic state.</p>","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2009-06-24 16:50:47 EST","primarySite":"www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915086,"name":"Technically Speaking","bodyOriginal":"skin, skin care, hair, hair care, makeup, antiperspirant, deodorants, emissions, vehicles","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2004-09-24 00:03:01 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915091,"name":"Multi-Sensory Technologies for Today's Effervescent Bath and Shower Products","bodyOriginal":"effervescent technology, carbonate salt, carbon dioxide, effervescent/exothermic technology","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2005-09-27 13:15:25 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915096,"name":"From Self Tanning to Tooth Whitening","bodyOriginal":"<p><strong>Skin and Skin Care</strong><br />\r\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company discloses antimicrobial cleansing compositions which are milt to skin and used with a dispensing article.

UV radiation has adverse effects, including sunburn, photoaging and skin cancer. These effects can only be prevented by protecting against the whole range of UV radiation, including UVA.</p>\n<p>On the other hand there is also a trend to limit the amount of &ldquo;chemicals&rdquo; on the skin. This means that very efficient UV absorbers should be available for the new requirement of broad UV protection. Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazinea (BEMT) has been designed to fulfill this requirement. It is photo-stable, oil-soluble, very efficient and covers the UVB and UVA range. Its physical and chemical properties are shown in <strong>Table 1</strong>. In the year 2000, European authorities added BEMT to the positive list of cosmetic UV absorbers.</p>\n<p>Due to their molecular structure, hydroxyphenyltriazines (HPTs) exhibit a UV spectrum with two distinctive absorption bands. This is due to the presence of two electronic transitions with strong dipole moments, both of which are polarized perpendicular to each other.</p>\n<p>In order to obtain broad-spectrum absorbance, OH and O-alkyl substituents have to be introduced at the three phenyl groups and positioned as shown in <strong>Figure 1</strong>.</p>\n<p>&bull; <em><strong>UVA:</strong></em> Two ortho-OH groups are required for efficient energy dissipation via intramolecular hydrogen bridges. In order to obtain strong absorption in the UVA, the para-positions of the two respective phenyl moieties should be substituted by O-alkyl, resulting in a bis-resorcinyl triazine chromophor.</p>\n<p>&bull; <em><strong>UVB:</strong> </em>The remaining phenyl group attached to the triazine leads to UVB absorption. It can be demonstrated that maximal &ldquo;full spectrum&rdquo; performance is achieved with O-alkyl located in the para-position. Without solubilizing substituents, HPTs are nearly insoluble in cosmetic oils. They exhibit the typical properties of pigments (e.g., high melting points). In order to increase solubility in oil phases, the structure of the UV filter has been modified accordingly. The introduction of two 2-ethyl-hexyl groups as shown in <strong>Figure 1</strong> results in the formation of BEMT, a new oilsoluble UV filter with true broad-spectrum performance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/documents/CT_118_02_047_06.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Download the complete article.</em></a></p>","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2019-08-29 11:27:23 EST","primarySite":"www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915326,"name":"Gelled Emollient Systems for Controlled Fragrance Release and Enhanced Product Performance","bodyOriginal":"<p>Traditionally, emollients for cosmetic applications are used in their original form, either as a liquid such as mineral oil and isopropyl palmitat or as a solid such as lanolin.</p>","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2013-03-15 16:19:39 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915331,"name":"In Closing: Testing Sun Protection Claims","bodyOriginal":"sun protection, sun-care, COLIPA, FDA, SPF","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2004-09-24 00:11:13 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915336,"name":"In Closing: Malassezia Species and the Cause of Dandruff","bodyOriginal":"malassezia species, dandruff","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2004-09-24 00:17:34 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915341,"name":"In Closing: Considerations when expanding operations overseas","bodyOriginal":"overseas, expanding overseas, abroad","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2004-08-25 13:22:13 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915346,"name":"New Cellulose Derivatives in Personal Care Formulations","bodyOriginal":"<p>Interactions between water-soluble polymers and surfactants have been extensively studied over the last decades.

We have covered the process of acquiring technology as well as examples of currently available, licensable technologies.</p>\r\n<p>In recent years, companies have taken an interesting twist towards the technology transfer process to derive benefits from their intellectual property assets by donating patent portfolios to non-profit organizations. These donations are not just acts of good will. Corporations have been deriving significant financial benefits through tax deductions on the value of these portfolios. The receiving groups, usually universities, also hope to benefit by utilizing the portfolio to enhance their existing research programs and eventually to obtain licensing income from them.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Managing intellectual assets: </strong></em>Managing intellectual assets is an important factor today in a company&rsquo;s overall strategy. Most companies have neither the resources to develop all the discoveries in their patent portfolios, nor do they all fit with their strategic objectives at any given time. An intellectual asset audit should put a company&rsquo;s holdings in one of several categories: in use (hold and consider license); no interest (abandon); defensive (hold); license or sell; and donate.</p>\r\n<p>What are the factors that influence a company&rsquo;s decision to donate or license their intellectual property? One of them is the increased cost of maintaining patents. Fees for patent maintenance in the United States tripled in 1992. Companies spend a considerable amount of money to maintain the patent after 3, 7 and 11 years of each active patent that they own. Therefore, the value of the patents to the company&rsquo;s current and future operations must be weighed against the cost to maintain them. The non-profit beneficiary of a donation has about half the maintenance fee burden carried by the large for-profit corporation. On close examination of their intellectual assets, many companies are finding it useful and financially beneficial to shed their underutilized or non-strategic patent holdings by licensing or donating.</p>","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2009-06-24 16:19:52 EST","primarySite":"www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915401,"name":"Bench and Beyond: Improving the Skin Model","bodyOriginal":"skin, skin model, EPISKIN, EpiDerm, SkinEthic, FRAME, stem cells, cloning cells, testing","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2004-09-24 00:08:17 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915406,"name":"Compass: The European Union","bodyOriginal":"European Union, EU, R&amp;D","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2004-09-24 00:10:34 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915411,"name":"Mexican Cosmetic Regulations: Part 2 of 2","bodyOriginal":"<p>This column is the second in a two-part series focusing on Mexican Cosmetic Regulations.

The results of this study indicate that no-lye relaxers show significantly less scalp irritation than lye relaxers, regardless of whether the irritation is rated as severe, moderate, mild or minor. Therefore, the no-lye relaxer is most suitable for individuals of African descent or for individuals with excessively curly hair and sensitive scalp.The authors believe that this study is the first salon study that compares the irritation potential of lye relaxers against no-lye relaxers. It could become a benchmark for the industry to develop newer, low irritation or non-irritation relaxers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Compared to Caucasian hair, African-American hair is extremely curly and its physical configuration resembles a twisted ribbon. It is highly unmanageable, very difficult to comb&mdash;both wet and dry&mdash;and hard to style. More fragile than Caucasian hair, this excessively curly hair breaks more easily when stretched or vigorously brushed and combed. Thus, African-American hair requires both special handling and haircare products that are differently formulated than those for Caucasian hair. </p>\n<p><strong>The Development of Relaxers</strong> <br />In the early 1900s, an African-American domestic worker, later known as Madam C. J. Walker, invented pomade using a combination of oils (see sidebar). This pomade revolutionized the hairstyling practices of African-American women and made excessively curly hair softer, shinier and somewhat easier to comb. However, the pomade did not straighten the hair. African-American women still could not achieve styles like those worn by Caucasian women. </p>\n<p>In 1905, Madam Walker invented a straightening comb to address this need.

The current experimental human model for skin, however, is largely based upon physical and biochemical properties known about white skin. Thus, anatomical or physiological properties in skin of different races that may alter a disease process or treatment of that disease are not being considered.</p>\r\n<p>While scientists have investigated racial differences in skin physiology, the amount of data obtained by objective methods is minimal. Additionally, the data are often confusing and contradictory.</p>\r\n<p>In our review of the objective data available in differentiating skin of several ethnicities, we found both cohesive and conflicting data in the realms of transepidermal water loss, water content, corneocyte variability, blood vessel reactivity, skin biomechanics, pH gradient, lipid content, surface microflora and mast cell granules.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is the most studied objective measure in defining differences between the skin of different ethnicities. TEWL has been used as a method of assessing the skin&rsquo;s ability to maintain an effective barrier against loss of body fluids and absorption of externally applied substances. Current literature defines TEWL as the total amount of water vapor loss through the skin and appendages under non-sweating conditions.</p>","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2009-06-24 16:16:42 EST","primarySite":"www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915891,"name":"Literature and Patent Review: Analytical and Test Methodologies 1990-2000, Part I","bodyOriginal":"<p>This article reviews some of the important methodologies and techniques published during the past ten years on the subject of cosmetics and toiletries.

It is often necessary to trap these sensitive substances first into a delivery vehicle in order to formulate an effective, stable product that provides perceivable benefits.</p>\r\n<p>For many centuries, powders of natural origin (powders such as silicates, carbonates and oxides) have been used in cosmetic formulations as fillers, texturing agents or coloring materials. For example, micas, which are silicate derivatives, have been applied in makeup and skin care products for their optical effects as well as their texturing properties.</p>\r\n<p>Today, a better understanding of the physical structure of modified micas gives the formulator several opportunities for using them as a unique delivery system and as a protection for a variety of hydrophilic compounds. Thus, for the first time, the field of the formulation will open to the mineral substances as encapsulating materials.</p>\r\n<p>In this article we will describe one of these mineral substances: magnesium sodium fluorosilicatea, a modified mica. We also report on experiments that test this material&rsquo;s behavior under conditions of hydration and dehydration, and a second study on the material&rsquo;s ability to encapsulate glycerin. Finally, we offer some formulations, tests and results of using the modified mica in cosmetic applications.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Magnesium Sodium Fluorosilicate</strong><br />\r\nMagnesium sodium fluorosilicate belongs to the new generation of modified micas with promising encapsulation capabilities. This special grade of mica, which we will call MSG, is synthesized by calcination at 800&deg;C for several hours using talc and a sodium silicofluoride under controlled atmosphere. The result is a sodium fluorine mica characterized by a particular crystalline structure with unique properties. This mica has a lamellar structure. In association with a median particle size less than 10 &mu;m, it provides a superior tactile feel to cosmetic formulations.</p>","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2009-06-24 16:09:41 EST","primarySite":"www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915901,"name":"A Quantitative Method of Measuring Color Expression Power in Eye Shadow","bodyOriginal":"interval scales, reflective coefficient, oil effect, color change, eye shadow","created":"2003-05-06 02:00:00 EST","updated":"2004-08-25 13:22:03 EST","primarySite":"old.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com","status":1},{"id":915906,"name":"Claims Support Literature Review-Part III, Hair Care","bodyOriginal":"<p><em>Editor's Note: This paper will be presented as a seies both in Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries magazine and on </em><a href=\"http://www.TheCosmeticSite.com\"><em>www.TheCosmeticSite.com</em></a><em>.
